# Remote Care (RemCare) web interface for Donors
For the Stop-Covid19 Hackathon launched by ConsensysHealth we build this Remote Care app (RemCare) who is for enabling donation in remote area.. They can be assigned to nearest center who deliver parcels..

## What's RemCare?
According to ISPI, “Africa is the continent that has most of the world’s poorest people living on less than two dollars a day. Most of these people derive their livelihoods from the informal economy, small-scale farming, livestock keeping, mining and fishing. They are self-reliant and show solidarity in their daily transactions. They do not have a salary or social security, and some may not even have savings accounts. This means that in the case of a lockdown they are likely to be adversely affected, living on daily transactions.” So Remcare is such a help for these remote population in this time of pandemic.

### Token streaming
We aim to use token/money streaming to enable donors to have full control over the donations.
